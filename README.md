#Revision


##Object-orientated programming

- language model organized around objects and data rather than "actions" and logic. Used to avoid dependencies when integrating new code into an app.

##What is integration testing?
A software development process which program units are combined and tested as groups in multiple ways. 

- Example creating branches on git to create independent tests and when they're functioning merge them to the master branch.

##What is unit testing?

where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. 
 
##What is a  for loop?
 
 Executes code once for each element in an expression.


 
 -Example: 
 		
 		def for(i) 	
		   for i in 0...6
				puts "My code name is #{i}" 
		
		     end 
		end 
		

##Seven prinicples of testing

1) reveal the presence of bugs

2) Exhausive testing is impossible

3) Early testing

4) Defect Clustering - where there's one defect they may be more around it. So create tests around that particular defect.

5) The pesticide paradox - The bugs may start getting past your tests.

6) Testing is context dependant - Different kinds of sites are tested differently.

7) Absence of errors fallacy - Finding no errors doesn't mean they're aren't any, just that you haven't found them yet.

##Tester/development mindset

**Testers** - A professional tester approaches a product with the attitude that the product is already broken - it has defects and it is their job to discover them. They assume the product or system is inherently flawed and it is their job to ‘illuminate’ the flaws.

**Developer** - 	
1) Learn to strap in and not stop until the job is done.	
2) Learn to love the pain. Or at least, not fight it - The best thing we can do for ourselves is to try our best to reframe how we think about coding.

##Testing terms

- Defects: issues in the app/code.

- Effects a defect might have on a project.

- Root cause vs Effect

- Error: unexpected result from a command.
- Failure

##Debugging and Testing

**Debugging** - used by developers to identify the cause of bugs or defects in code and undertake corrections.

**Testing** - systematic exploration with the aim of finding and reporting defects.



##Software and development life cycle

[The cycle](http://www.stylusinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/SDLC.jpg)

- Requirement gathering and analysis.

- Design.

- Implementation or coding.
- Testing.
- Deployment.
- Maintenance.

##Waterfall model
The software development activity is divided into different phases and each phase consists of series of tasks and has different objectives. 	

You don't move to the next phase until the current one has been signed off.

##V-Model 
- Also means [validation and verification model.](http://testingfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vmodel.png) 
- An extension of waterfall model. 


##Scrum
Is an agile framework, used for small teams (between 7-10). Usually relies on 2- week development cycles called 'sprints.' The roles include:

- A product owner (decides the requirements and expectations)
- The scrum master(regulates the team, also discuss the scope with the product owner.)
- The devops team: consist of 3-9 people and actually implement.

##Json

- Readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.
